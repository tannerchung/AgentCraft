## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: React + FastAPI Stack (Recommended)

The main application runs a React frontend with FastAPI backend:

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Start the full stack application
python main.py
```

This will start:
- React frontend on port 3000
- FastAPI backend on port 8000
- Interactive demo interface

### Option 2: Streamlit Dashboard

For a simpler demonstration interface:

```bash
# Run Streamlit version
python main.py --streamlit
```

### 3. Access the Application

- **React Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Streamlit Demo**: http://localhost:5000 (if using --streamlit)
