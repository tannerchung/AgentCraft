# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive dashboard and monitoring system that exposes multi-agent system operations in a consumable way for users. The system will provide real-time visibility into how agents interact, make decisions, and self-improve through key integrations including CrewAI event capture, LLM selection intelligence, performance metrics tracking, training effectiveness monitoring, testing validation, planning accuracy analysis, and collaboration insights.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view all CrewAI interactions in real-time, so that I can monitor agent behavior and troubleshoot issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CrewAI interaction occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically capture and log the event with timestamp, agent identifiers, and interaction details
2. WHEN viewing the CrewAI events dashboard THEN the system SHALL display events in chronological order with filtering capabilities by agent, event type, and time range
3. WHEN an event is selected THEN the system SHALL show detailed information including input parameters, output results, and execution context
4. IF an interaction fails THEN the system SHALL highlight the error with diagnostic information and suggested remediation steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a technical user, I want to understand how the system selects LLMs for different tasks, so that I can optimize performance and costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an LLM selection decision is made THEN the system SHALL track the decision with complete rationale including performance criteria, cost considerations, and task requirements
2. WHEN viewing LLM selection analytics THEN the system SHALL display selection patterns, success rates, and decision factors in visual charts and graphs
3. WHEN comparing LLM performance THEN the system SHALL show side-by-side metrics for quality, speed, cost, and reliability across different models
4. IF selection criteria change THEN the system SHALL log the configuration changes and their impact on subsequent decisions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want detailed metrics across all system operations, so that I can identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system operations execute THEN the system SHALL collect detailed metrics for quality, speed, cost, and reliability with sub-second precision
2. WHEN viewing performance dashboards THEN the system SHALL display real-time and historical metrics with customizable time ranges and aggregation levels
3. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL generate alerts with contextual information and recommended actions
4. WHEN exporting metrics THEN the system SHALL provide data in multiple formats including CSV, JSON, and API endpoints for external analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI trainer, I want to monitor CrewAI training cycles and their effectiveness, so that I can improve agent learning outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CrewAI training cycles execute THEN the system SHALL monitor and record training progress, convergence metrics, and improvement indicators
2. WHEN viewing training effectiveness reports THEN the system SHALL show before/after performance comparisons, learning curves, and skill acquisition patterns
3. WHEN training cycles complete THEN the system SHALL automatically evaluate improvement and suggest next training steps or parameter adjustments
4. IF training effectiveness degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and provide diagnostic information about potential causes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test result analysis and optimization recommendations, so that I can ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests execute THEN the system SHALL capture detailed results including pass/fail status, execution time, resource usage, and error details
2. WHEN viewing test validation dashboards THEN the system SHALL display test coverage, success rates, and trend analysis with drill-down capabilities
3. WHEN test failures occur THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze patterns and suggest optimization strategies or configuration changes
4. WHEN test suites complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports with actionable insights for system improvement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to track plan versus execution accuracy, so that I can improve orchestration and resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plans are created THEN the system SHALL establish baseline expectations for timeline, resource usage, and deliverable quality
2. WHEN plans execute THEN the system SHALL track actual performance against planned metrics in real-time
3. WHEN viewing planning accuracy reports THEN the system SHALL show variance analysis, trend patterns, and predictive insights for future planning
4. IF significant deviations occur THEN the system SHALL alert stakeholders and provide recommendations for plan adjustments or process improvements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want insights into multi-agent interaction patterns, so that I can optimize collaboration and identify communication bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents interact THEN the system SHALL capture communication patterns, message flows, and collaboration effectiveness metrics
2. WHEN viewing collaboration insights THEN the system SHALL display interaction networks, communication frequency, and collaboration success rates through visual representations
3. WHEN analyzing agent relationships THEN the system SHALL identify optimal collaboration patterns and suggest improvements for agent coordination
4. WHEN collaboration issues arise THEN the system SHALL detect communication bottlenecks and provide recommendations for workflow optimization

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a business user, I want a unified dashboard that consolidates all multi-agent operations, so that I can get a holistic view of system performance without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the main dashboard THEN the system SHALL display key performance indicators, system health status, and recent activity summaries in an intuitive interface
2. WHEN customizing dashboard views THEN the system SHALL allow users to configure widgets, metrics, and layouts based on their role and preferences
3. WHEN drilling down into specific areas THEN the system SHALL provide seamless navigation between high-level overviews and detailed technical information
4. WHEN sharing insights THEN the system SHALL support report generation, data export, and collaborative annotation features for stakeholder communication
