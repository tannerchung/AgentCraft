# Adaptive Multi-LLM System with Self-Improvement Loop

This document describes AgentCraft's revolutionary **Adaptive Multi-LLM System** that implements hot-swappable LLMs with continuous self-improvement capabilities using CrewAI's advanced features.

## üéØ System Overview

The Adaptive Multi-LLM System provides:
- **Hot-swappable LLMs** based on real-time performance metrics
- **Self-improving orchestration** that learns from every interaction
- **CrewAI integration** with memory, planning, collaboration, and reasoning
- **Continuous training** and testing framework
- **Cost-quality-speed optimization** for maximum efficiency

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. LLM Pool (`LLMPool`)
Manages multiple LLMs with performance tracking:

```python
models = {
    "fast": LLM(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.1),           # Quick responses
    "balanced": LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.2),         # Cost-effective
    "powerful": LLM(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", temperature=0.1),  # Complex analysis
    "reasoning": LLM(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", temperature=0.0), # Logic problems
    "creative": LLM(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0.7),             # Content generation
    "local": LLM(model="ollama/llama3.1", base_url="localhost")   # Privacy/cost
}
```

**Performance Metrics Tracked:**
- Response times and quality scores
- Cost per token and success rates
- Expertise areas and token usage
- Error counts and efficiency scores

#### 2. Intelligent Orchestrator (`IntelligentOrchestrator`)
AI-powered orchestrator that selects optimal LLMs:

- **Query Complexity Analysis**: Determines the sophistication needed (0.0-1.0 scale)
- **Dynamic LLM Selection**: Chooses best model based on task type and metrics  
- **Memory Integration**: Uses CrewAI's short-term, long-term, and entity memory
- **Planning System**: Implements CrewAI planning for complex tasks

#### 3. Adaptive Multi-Agent System (`AdaptiveMultiAgentSystem`)
Complete system with specialists using optimal LLMs:

- **Specialist Agents**: Technical, Competitive, Customer Success
- **Collaboration Framework**: Agents work together with memory sharing
- **Performance Tracking**: Continuous learning from outcomes
- **Testing & Training**: Built-in evaluation and improvement

## üîÑ Self-Improvement Loop

### 1. Performance Tracking
Every interaction is tracked:
```python
metrics = {
    "response_time": execution_time,
    "quality_score": ai_evaluated_score, 
    "token_usage": {"input": tokens_in, "output": tokens_out},
    "user_satisfaction": feedback_score,
    "success": error_free_execution
}
```

### 2. Dynamic Model Selection
Selection algorithm considers:
- **Quality**: Historical quality scores for task type
- **Speed**: Response time requirements
- **Cost**: Token usage and API costs  
- **Reliability**: Success rate and error patterns
- **Expertise**: Domain-specific performance

### 3. Continuous Learning
System improves through:
- **Weight Adjustment**: Selection criteria updated based on performance
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learning optimal model combinations
- **Feedback Integration**: User satisfaction influences future selections
- **Error Analysis**: Failure patterns inform model reliability

## üß† CrewAI Features Integration

### Memory Systems
```python
# Short-term memory for conversation context
short_term_memory = ShortTermMemory()

# Long-term memory for learning patterns
long_term_memory = LongTermMemory() 

# Entity memory for recurring issues
entity_memory = EntityMemory()
```

### Planning & Reasoning  
```python
# AI-driven task planning
planner = CrewPlanner(
    planning_llm=orchestrator_llm,
    planning_agent=orchestrator_agent
)

# Multi-step reasoning for complex queries
crew = Crew(
    agents=[orchestrator, technical_specialist, competitive_analyst],
    planning=True,
    memory=True,
    collaboration=True
)
```

### Collaboration
- **Intelligent Delegation**: Orchestrator routes to appropriate specialists
- **Context Sharing**: Agents share knowledge through memory systems
- **Coordination**: Multiple agents collaborate on complex problems
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Learning propagates across agent interactions

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Quality-Cost-Speed Balance

The system optimizes across three dimensions:

1. **Quality Score**: AI-evaluated response accuracy and helpfulness (1-10)
2. **Response Time**: End-to-end execution time in seconds  
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Quality per dollar spent on API calls

**Efficiency Formula:**
```python
efficiency_score = (quality / cost_per_token) * (1 + speed_bonus)
speed_bonus = max(0, (5.0 - response_time) / 5.0) * 0.2
```

### Model Selection Logic

```python
def calculate_model_score(model_name, task_type, complexity, metrics):
    base_score = metrics.efficiency_score
    expertise_bonus = 0.2 if task_type in metrics.expertise_areas else 0
    complexity_bonus = get_complexity_bonus(model_name, complexity)
    reliability_penalty = metrics.error_rate * 0.5
    
    return base_score + expertise_bonus + complexity_bonus - reliability_penalty
```

## üß™ Testing & Training Framework

### Automated Testing
```python
test_cases = [
    {
        "query": "Fix webhook 403 error",
        "expected_outcome": {
            "max_time": 30.0,
            "min_quality": 7.0,  
            "required_specialists": ["technical"]
        }
    }
]

results = adaptive_system.test_system(test_cases)
```

### Continuous Training
```python
training_data = [
    {
        "query": "webhook integration issue",
        "quality_score": 8.5,
        "user_satisfaction": 9.0,
        "execution_time": 2.3,
        "selected_llms": {"technical": "powerful"}
    }
]

adaptive_system.train_system(training_data)
```

### Quality Evaluation
Responses are evaluated using a dedicated LLM:
```python
evaluation_prompt = f"""
Rate this AI response on accuracy, completeness, relevance, 
clarity, and professionalism for {task_type}:

Query: {query}
Response: {response}

Return numeric score 1.0-10.0
"""
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Query Processing
```python
result = adaptive_system.process_query_with_adaptive_llms(
    "Our webhook endpoint returns 403 errors after API v2.1.3 update",
    {"priority": "high", "complexity": "technical"}
)

print(f"LLMs used: {result['llms_used']}")
print(f"Quality: {result['performance_metrics']['avg_quality']}/10")
print(f"Time: {result['performance_metrics']['execution_time']:.1f}s")
```

### Training with Feedback
```python
# After user interaction, train the system
feedback = {
    "query": original_query,
    "quality_score": user_rating,
    "user_satisfaction": satisfaction_score, 
    "execution_time": measured_time,
    "selected_llms": result["llms_used"]
}

adaptive_system.train_system([feedback])
```

### Performance Analytics  
```python
metrics = adaptive_system.llm_pool.get_performance_summary()
insights = adaptive_system.generate_optimization_insights()

print(f"Best model: {insights['most_efficient_model']}")  
print(f"Recommendations: {insights['recommendations']}")
