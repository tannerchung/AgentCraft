## 1. Introduction (5 minutes)

### Who Am I?
- **Background:** Experienced AI/ML architect with [X years] in distributed systems and multi-agent frameworks
- **Recent Focus:** Production AI agent deployments, cost optimization, and custom LLM orchestration
- **Unique Perspective:** Hands-on experience building production-ready multi-agent systems without vendor lock-in
- **Philosophy:** "Build vs Buy" advocate - demonstrating when custom solutions deliver superior ROI

### Personal AI Journey
- Started with rule-based systems, evolved through ML pipelines to modern LLM orchestration
- **Key Insight:** Enterprise platforms often over-engineer simple problems while under-engineering complex ones
- **Mission:** Prove that custom AI agent frameworks can outperform enterprise platforms at 1/10th the cost

## 2. Main Presentation (45 minutes)

### Learning Process & Technical Discovery (8 minutes)

#### Why I Built AgentCraft
```
The Enterprise AI Dilemma:
• $2,500-5,000/month for basic AI agent capabilities
• Vendor lock-in with limited customization
• Generic responses that don't understand your business
• Months of implementation time

My Solution:
• Production-ready system in 2 weeks
• $300-800/month total cost
• Unlimited customization and business logic
• 20+ specialized agents with real-time collaboration
```

#### Technical Learning Journey
1. **Week 1:** Evaluated Salesforce AgentForce, Microsoft Copilot Studio, Google Vertex AI
2. **Week 2:** Built initial proof-of-concept with CrewAI + FastAPI
3. **Week 3:** Added real-time WebSocket communication and database persistence
4. **Week 4:** Integrated external knowledge sources and human-in-the-loop workflows

**Key Discovery:** Enterprise platforms are "one-size-fits-all" - custom solutions are "perfect-fit"
