# Galileo AI Observability Integration

This document explains how Galileo is integrated into AgentCraft for AI observability and monitoring.

## Setup Complete âœ…

Galileo has been successfully integrated into AgentCraft with the following components:

### 1. Dependencies Installed
- `galileo` - Galileo AI observability platform
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management

### 2. Environment Configuration
The following environment variables are configured in `.env`:

```bash
GALILEO_API_KEY=your_galileo_api_key_here
GALILEO_PROJECT=AgentCraft
GALILEO_LOG_STREAM=production
GALILEO_CONSOLE_URL=https://console.galileo.ai
```

### 3. Backend Integration
Located in `/backend/main.py`:

- **Automatic Event Listener**: CrewAI events are automatically captured
- **Lifespan Management**: Galileo is initialized on FastAPI startup
- **Enhanced Metrics**: Real-time observability metrics via `/api/galileo-metrics`

### 4. Key Features

#### Automatic Trace Logging
- All CrewAI agent interactions are automatically logged to Galileo
- No manual instrumentation required
- Traces include conversation context, model performance, and quality metrics

#### Real-time Monitoring
Access comprehensive metrics via the API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/galileo-metrics
```

Returns:
- Conversation quality scores
- Token usage and costs
- Model performance metrics
- Agent insights and learning velocity
- Quality metrics (groundedness, relevance, completeness)

#### Dashboard Integration
- Performance Analytics tab shows Galileo metrics
- Real-time traces and quality monitoring
- Cost analysis and optimization insights

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Initialization
When the FastAPI server starts:
```python
# In backend/main.py lifespan function
if GALILEO_AVAILABLE:
    CrewAIEventListener()  # Automatically captures all CrewAI events
```

### 2. Agent Execution Monitoring
Every time a CrewAI agent processes a query:
- Input/output traces are logged
- Performance metrics are captured
- Quality scores are calculated
- Costs are tracked

### 3. Dashboard Visualization
The AgentCraft dashboard displays:
- Real-time conversation quality
- Model performance trends
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Agent effectiveness metrics

## Benefits

### For Development
- **Debug AI Issues**: See exact conversation flows and model responses
- **Optimize Performance**: Track latency, token usage, and costs
- **Quality Assurance**: Monitor hallucinations, groundedness, and relevance

### for Production
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time observability of all AI interactions
- **Cost Management**: Track and optimize AI spending
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify and resolve bottlenecks

### For Business
- **ROI Measurement**: Track AI system effectiveness
- **Quality Metrics**: Ensure consistent AI performance
- **Competitive Analysis**: Compare against baseline metrics

## Testing

Run the integration test:
```bash
uv run python3 test_galileo_integration.py
```

Expected output:
```
âœ… GALILEO_PROJECT: AgentCraft
âœ… GALILEO_LOG_STREAM: production
âœ… GALILEO_API_KEY: ********MszI (masked)
âœ… Galileo CrewAI handler imported successfully
âœ… CrewAI Event Listener initialized successfully
ðŸŽ‰ Galileo integration test completed successfully!
```

## Accessing Your Data

1. Visit your Galileo console: https://console.galileo.ai/
2. Navigate to the "AgentCraft" project
3. View the "production" log stream
4. Analyze conversations, quality metrics, and performance data

## Next Steps

1. **Start the backend**: `uv run python3 backend/main.py`
2. **Use Agent Chat**: Submit queries through the AgentCraft interface
3. **Check Galileo**: View traces in your Galileo dashboard
4. **Monitor Metrics**: Use the Performance Analytics tab in AgentCraft

The integration is now complete and ready for production use!
