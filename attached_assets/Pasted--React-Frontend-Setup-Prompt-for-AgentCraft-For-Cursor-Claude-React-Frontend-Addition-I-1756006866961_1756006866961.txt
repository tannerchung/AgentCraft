# React Frontend Setup Prompt for AgentCraft

## For Cursor/Claude - React Frontend Addition:

```
I need to pivot from Streamlit to React for AgentCraft because I need real-time interactions without page refreshes for my live demo. This is a technical presentation to Salesforce architects, so it needs to look professional and impressive.

Please help me create a modern React frontend with:

**Architecture:**
- React frontend (port 3000)
- FastAPI backend (port 8000) 
- Real-time agent interactions
- Professional dashboard design

**Key Components Needed:**

1. **Main Dashboard** (`src/components/Dashboard.js`)
   - Live metrics comparison (Our solution vs AgentForce)
   - Real-time performance indicators
   - Cost savings calculator
   - Professional charts/graphs

2. **Agent Chat Interface** (`src/components/AgentChat.js`)
   - ChatGPT-style interface for agent testing
   - Real-time responses without page refresh
   - Multiple agent selection (Technical, Billing, Competitive)
   - Message history and context

3. **Competitive Analysis Panel** (`src/components/CompetitiveAnalysis.js`)
   - Live competitive intelligence demo
   - Side-by-side comparison with "AgentForce blocked" simulation
   - Interactive competitor selection

4. **Multi-Agent Orchestration Demo** (`src/components/MultiAgentDemo.js`)
   - Show multiple agents collaborating on complex scenarios
   - Real-time agent coordination visualization
   - Progress indicators for each agent's contribution

**Tech Stack:**
- React 18 with hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling (professional, clean design)
- Axios for API calls
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Recharts for data visualization
- Lucide React for icons

**Design Requirements:**
- Salesforce Lightning Design System inspired (they'll love this!)
- Professional blue/white color scheme
- Responsive design for presentation screens
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Loading states and error handling

**API Integration:**
- RESTful endpoints for agent interactions
- WebSocket for real-time chat
- File upload for document analysis demo
- Voice input handling for voice demo

**Project Structure:**
```
agentcraft-frontend/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dashboard.js
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AgentChat.js
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CompetitiveAnalysis.js
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MultiAgentDemo.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ App.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
```

**Key Features to Implement:**
1. Real-time chat with agents (no page refresh)
2. Live metrics dashboard with animated counters
3. Interactive cost calculator with real-time updates
4. WebSocket connection for instant responses
5. Professional loading states and error handling
6. Mobile-responsive for different presentation setups

**Competitive Demo Features:**
- Show "AgentForce Response: Blocked by guardrails" vs our real analysis
- Live cost comparison calculator
- Real-time agent collaboration demo
- Voice input processing (if supported)
- Document upload and analysis

Please start with the basic React app setup, main Dashboard component, and API service layer. Focus on making it look professional and impressive for a technical architecture presentation.

The goal is to create a modern, real-time interface that showcases the technical sophistication of custom agent architecture compared to platform limitations.
```

## Additional Context Prompts:

### **For the Backend API:**
```
I also need a FastAPI backend to serve the React frontend. Please create:

**FastAPI Backend** (`backend/main.py`):
- CORS enabled for React frontend
- WebSocket endpoint for real-time chat
- RESTful endpoints for agent interactions
- File upload for document analysis
- Integration with CrewAI agents

**Key Endpoints:**
- POST /api/chat - Send message to agent
- WebSocket /ws - Real-time chat connection  
- POST /api/competitive-analysis - Competitive intelligence
- GET /api/metrics - Performance metrics
- POST /api/upload-document - Document analysis

Make it production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and response formatting.
```

### **For Professional Styling:**
```
Style the React components to look like a professional Salesforce Lightning application:

- Use Tailwind CSS with a blue/white professional theme
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Cards and panels for different sections
- Professional typography and spacing
- Loading spinners and progress indicators
- Hover effects and interactive elements
- Responsive design for presentation screens

Focus on making it look polished and impressive for a technical architecture demo.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why This Is The Right Choice**

**With AI coding tools, React becomes:**
- **Faster to build** than you think (AI handles complexity)
- **More impressive** to Salesforce architects
- **Better for live demos** (no refresh issues)
- **Professional appearance** they expect
- **Real-time capabilities** essential for presentation

**Timeline becomes:**
- **Day 1**: React setup + basic dashboard
- **Day 2**: Agent chat interfaces + competitive analysis  
- **Day 3**: Multi-agent demo + polish
- **Day 4**: Final testing + presentation prep

You made the right call - **React + AI tools = perfect combination** for your presentation! ðŸš€
