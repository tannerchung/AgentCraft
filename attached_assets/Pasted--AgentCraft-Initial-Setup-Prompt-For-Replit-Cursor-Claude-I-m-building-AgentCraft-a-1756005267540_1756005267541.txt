# AgentCraft - Initial Setup Prompt

## For Replit/Cursor/Claude:

```
I'm building "AgentCraft" - a demonstration of specialized AI agent architecture that showcases the value of domain expertise over generic topic handling. This is for a technical presentation to Salesforce architects showing how specialized agents can complement their AgentForce platform.

Please help me create the initial project structure with:

1. **Core Framework**: CrewAI-based multi-agent system
2. **First Specialized Agent**: Technical Support Specialist with webhook expertise
3. **Demo Focus**: Show specific technical knowledge vs generic responses
4. **Professional Tone**: Respectful comparison, not aggressive competition

**Project Structure Needed:**
```
agentcraft/
├── src/
│   ├── agents/
│   │   └── technical_support_agent.py
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── base_agent.py
│   │   └── agent_router.py
│   ├── tools/
│   │   └── webhook_analysis_tool.py
│   └── demo/
│       └── streamlit_dashboard.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
└── .env.example
```

**Key Features to Implement:**
1. Technical Support Agent with webhook troubleshooting expertise
2. Webhook Analysis Tool that provides specific code-level solutions
3. Simple routing system for agent selection
4. Basic Streamlit demo showing agent capabilities
5. Performance tracking to measure response quality

**Technical Requirements:**
- Python 3.11+
- CrewAI for agent orchestration
- OpenAI/Anthropic API integration
- Streamlit for demo interface
- Professional error handling
- Clean, documented code

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Focus on "specialized expertise" vs "generic topic handling"
- Emphasize "architectural flexibility" vs "platform constraints"
- Show "domain knowledge depth" vs "template responses"
- Demonstrate "rapid customization" vs "vendor roadmap dependency"

Please start with the basic project structure, requirements.txt, and the first Technical Support Agent that can handle webhook integration issues with specific technical expertise.

The goal is to show how specialized agents can provide more accurate, helpful responses than generic topic-based systems, while respecting that both approaches have value in different contexts.

## Additional Context for Your Development:

**Key Messages to Embed:**
- "Specialized expertise delivers superior customer outcomes"
- "Architectural flexibility enables rapid innovation"  
- "Domain knowledge creates competitive advantage"
- "Custom solutions complement platform approaches"

**Avoid These Phrases:**
- "AgentForce killer" or similar aggressive language
- "Replace Salesforce" messaging
- Any direct criticism of their technical choices
- Dismissive language about platform approaches

**Professional Positioning:**
- "Alternative architectural approach"
- "Specialized expertise focus"
- "Custom solution capabilities"
- "Complementary technology demonstration"

This approach will resonate well with Salesforce architects who appreciate technical sophistication while respecting their current platform investments.
